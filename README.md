## AI-Driven Personalized Learning Assistant 🎓🤖

This project aims to improve engineering education for students in semi-urban and rural institutions by providing a personalized, AI-powered learning experience.

Traditional teaching methods often fail to address individual learning speeds, weak fundamentals, and limited academic support. This platform solves that gap by offering an intelligent learning assistant that adapts to each student’s level and learning needs.

### 🚀 Key Features
- AI-powered doubt solving with accurate, subject-specific answers
- Personalized learning paths based on student performance
- Simple and clear explanations for complex engineering concepts
- Practice questions, quizzes, and instant feedback
- Support for exam preparation and project guidance
- Faculty dashboard for monitoring student progress

### 🎯 Objective
To make quality engineering education accessible, adaptive, and effective for students regardless of their geographical location.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React
- Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask)
- Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- AI Integration: Large Language Models (LLMs)

This project is developed as part of an academic initiative and can be extended into a scalable educational platform in the future.
